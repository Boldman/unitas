  # > dependencies used in the boost override.
  # >
  # > The second argument (super) corresponds to the result of the evaluation of the previous
  # > stages of Nixpkgs. It does not contain any of the packages added by the current overlay,
  # > nor any of the following overlays. This set should be used either to refer to packages you
  # > wish to override, or to access functions defined in Nixpkgs. For example, the original
  # > recipe of boost in the above example, comes from super, as well as the callPackage function.
